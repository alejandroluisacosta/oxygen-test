Technical test for Oxygen Training Program.

This assigment consisted on replicating a website for unit convertion based on a Figma desing facilitaded by Oxygen, and was intended to be coded in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js and Redux.

Based on my knowledge at the assignment date (February, 2024), I decided to use only HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
